Using an in silico discovery dataset of patients with paired normal tissue samples form gene array data, we uncovered the top genes over-expressed in ccRCC. We collected surgically resected ccRCC specimens and employed targeted LC/MS-MS of normal and malignant tissue sample pairs to validate the strongest genes. Finally, a support vector machine-based classification algorithm using the protein-level data was set up.  

In the ccRCCpredictor folder one can find the best performing SVM modell with an R code to use it for own data and an example file. Using this code one can easily try the algorithm using both the example file or even own data.  

Data files and R codes can be found in the meta folder, In silco examinations and proteomic data analysis are separated to different subfolders. In case you need the raw files of MS please contact us.
